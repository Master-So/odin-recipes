    <p>Description
        Poha is a light and healthy Indian breakfast dish made from flattened rice (also called beaten rice). It's commonly enjoyed in western India and is known for its simplicity, flavor, and ease of preparation.
        This dish is typically cooked with onions, mustard seeds, green chilies, turmeric, and garnished with coriander and lemon juice for a refreshing touch.
